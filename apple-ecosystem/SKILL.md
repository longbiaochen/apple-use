# Apple Ecosystem

Use the local Apple app toolchain already available on macOS. This skill is the router for the Apple app skills in this repo.

If the `apple-use` Codex plugin is installed, prefer its MCP tools first. Otherwise use the root skills directly.

Use this routing:

- Notes or Apple Notes app -> `apple-notes`
- Reminders or Apple Reminders app -> `apple-reminders`
- Mail.app, Apple Mail, inbox triage, draft/send/search email -> `apple-mail`

Shared tool policy:

- `memo` for Apple Notes
- `remindctl` for Apple Reminders
- `fruitmail` for fast Apple Mail search/read
- `osascript`, `sqlite3`, and `shortcuts` for native macOS automation

Rules:

- Prefer local Apple app workflows over browser automation when a local CLI exists.
- Keep data local-first. Do not introduce third-party APIs or OAuth when the request can be completed through Apple apps already configured on the machine.
- For write actions in Mail.app, Reminders, or Notes, confirm destructive or ambiguous actions before executing them.
- For Mail, draft before send by default.
- Read [../docs/agent-contract.md](../docs/agent-contract.md) when you need the shared cross-agent invariants for this skill pack.
