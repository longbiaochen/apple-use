# Apple Use

Use this skill when the `apple-use` Codex plugin is installed. It is the preferred Codex entry point for this repository.

What it packages:

- an MCP server with Apple Notes, Reminders, Mail, and doctor tools
- the same local-first safety defaults as the canonical app skill folders in this repo
- the existing Apple CLIs and helper scripts already used by this repo

Use the MCP server first:

- `apple_doctor` to inspect local dependencies and permissions
- `apple_notes_*` for structured Apple Notes operations
- `apple_reminders_*` for Apple Reminders operations, including authorization checks
- `apple_mail_*` for Apple Mail search, drafts, send, and exact-message actions

Rules:

- Keep workflows local-first on macOS.
- Draft email before send by default.
- Confirm destructive or ambiguous writes before executing them.
- Use `apple_doctor` first when Notes or Reminders permissions appear unhealthy.
- If the plugin is unavailable, fall back to the canonical skill folders in the repo root.

Read [../../references/workflows.md](../../references/workflows.md) for install steps, tool routing, and the fallback model.
