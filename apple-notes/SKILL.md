# Apple Notes

Use `memo notes` to manage Apple Notes directly from the terminal.

If the `apple-use` Codex plugin is installed, prefer its `apple_notes_*` MCP tools first. Fall back to `memo notes` when the plugin is unavailable.

Setup:

- Check the CLI: `memo --help`
- If Notes access is blocked, ask the user to grant Automation access to the terminal app in System Settings.

Guidance:

- Use search before edit or delete when the target note is ambiguous.
- `memo` relies on interactive flows for some actions; if a non-interactive path is needed, explain the limitation and use the closest safe command.
- The plugin may use native Notes automation for structured Codex tool calls because some `memo` edit flows are interactive.
- Notes with images or attachments may not support full edit flows.

When not to use:

- If the user wants reminders or alerts, use `apple-reminders`.
- If the user wants email drafting or inbox work, use `apple-mail`.
